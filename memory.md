## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend

#### Component Architecture
- Following KISS and DRY principles with focused components under 200 lines
- Using shadcn/ui components based on Radix UI primitives
- Consistent error handling with Toast notifications
- Responsive design that works on all devices

#### Request Builder State Persistence
- Using React Context API with the RequestBuilderContext provider
- Storing form state (URL, method, headers, body) and API response in context
- Persisting data in localStorage for session continuity
- Allowing users to navigate between tabs without losing their work

#### New Mini Request Builder
- Simplified version of the full request builder

- Seamless transition to the full request builder when needed
- Straightforward UI focusing on URL and method selection
- Toast notifications for response feedback

#### Rate Limit Visualization
- Progress bars showing usage with color-coded indicators
- Alert components for warning and critical rate limit states
- Clear empty state with instructions when no data is available
- Only showing rate limits for APIs with stored API keys

#### API Client
- Central `api` object with standard HTTP methods in `api.ts`
- Automatic token inclusion for authenticated requests
- Consistent error handling and response formatting

#### State Management
- Using React hooks with TypeScript for type safety
- Context API for shared state (Request Builder)
- API communication using the api client
- Authentication state stored in localStorage

#### Navigation
- React Router for routing between pages
- Protected routes that redirect to login if not authenticated
- Consistent Sidebar navigation across all dashboard pages
- Active route highlighting in Sidebar

### Backend

- JWT token-based authentication
- In-memory user database for development
- Proper token validation and error handling

#### API Key Management
- Moto for mocking DynamoDB interactions
- Encrypted storage of API keys using Fernet
- Full CRUD operations with authentication checks
- Automatic removal of associated rate limits when keys are deleted

#### Rate Limit Tracking
- Redis for storing and retrieving rate limit data
- Tracking rate limits only when stored API keys are used
- Automatic normalization of API names for consistency
- Time-based expiration of rate limit data

#### Proxy Service
- Implemented with httpx for forwarding API requests

### Dashboard Statistics

The dashboard now displays real-time statistics through a dedicated backend endpoint that aggregates data from multiple sources:

1. **Total API Keys**: Counts the number of API keys stored by the user
2. **API Calls**: Tracks the total number of API requests made in the last 30 days
3. **Success Rate**: Calculates the percentage of successful API calls (status code < 400)
4. **Average Latency**: Measures the average response time across all API calls
5. **Rate Limits**: Shows rate limit usage with visual progress indicators

The implementation uses:
- In-memory request logging for development (would use CloudWatch in production)
- Redis for storing rate limit information
- Aggregated statistics endpoint to reduce client-side data processing
- Optimistic UI updates with loading states for a responsive experience

### Request Logging

A new request logging system was implemented to track API usage:
- Each API call is logged with timestamp, URL, method, status code and response time
- Logs are filtered by user to maintain data isolation
- Logs can be queried by date range for historical analysis
- Success rate is calculated based on HTTP status codes
- Average latency provides insights into API performance

### Dashboard UI Improvements

The dashboard UI was enhanced with:
- Skeleton loading states during data fetching
- Color-coded rate limit indicators (green/yellow/red based on remaining capacity)
- Refresh button to manually update statistics
- Empty states with helpful user guidance
- Concise formatting of statistics (e.g., response times in ms/s)
- Mini API request builder for quick testing
- Removal of unused notification features

## Notes

- Frontend development server runs on port 5173 (or next available port if busy)
- Backend API runs on port 8000
- The project successfully implements all features from Phases 1-6
- All user flows work as expected:
  - User authentication
  - API key management
  - API request building and testing
  - Rate limit visualization
  - Navigation between dashboard sections
- Project follows best practices:
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
  - TDD (Test-Driven Development)
  - Component-based architecture
  - Type safety with TypeScript
  - Consistent error handling

To run the project:
1. Start the backend: `cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

## Project Status

The project is now complete, with all core features implemented and working as expected. The final phase focused on dashboard statistics, performance optimizations, and streamlining the user interface to provide a comprehensive API management experience.

The application now offers:
- Secure API key management
- Easy-to-use API request building and testing
- Visual rate limit monitoring
- Comprehensive dashboard with usage statistics
- State persistence for a seamless user experience
- Quick testing through the mini request builder

All requirements from the project specification have been met, creating a fully functional personal API dashboard.
