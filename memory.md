# Personal API Dashboard - Memory File

## Current State

The project is a web application for managing API keys and monitoring API usage across various services. It consists of a frontend built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS/Shadcn UI, and a backend using FastAPI and Python.

- Rate limit tracking and visualization for API keys
- State persistence between tabs for the API Request Builder
- Dashboard with real-time statistics for API usage
- Request history display directly on the dashboard
- Real-time dashboard updates when API keys are changed

Recent improvements that were implemented:
- Added dashboard statistics functionality with dynamic data fetching
- Implemented API request logging to track calls, success rates, and latency
- Added average latency calculation for API requests
- Created advanced rate limit visualization on the dashboard
- Added success rate calculation for API requests
- Implemented dashboard refresh functionality to update statistics on demand
- Improved empty state handling with helpful instructions

### Dashboard Statistics

The dashboard now displays real-time statistics through a dedicated backend endpoint that aggregates data from multiple sources:

1. **Total API Keys**: Counts the number of API keys stored by the user
2. **API Calls**: Tracks the total number of API requests made in the last 30 days
3. **Success Rate**: Calculates the percentage of successful API calls (status code < 400)
4. **Average Latency**: Measures the average response time across all API calls
5. **Rate Limits**: Shows rate limit usage with visual progress indicators

The implementation uses:
- In-memory request logging for development (would use CloudWatch in production)
- Redis for storing rate limit information
- Aggregated statistics endpoint to reduce client-side data processing
- Optimistic UI updates with loading states for a responsive experience

### Request Logging

A new request logging system was implemented to track API usage:
- Each API call is logged with timestamp, URL, method, status code and response time
- Logs are filtered by user to maintain data isolation
- Logs can be queried by date range for historical analysis
- Success rate is calculated based on HTTP status codes
- Average latency provides insights into API performance
- Request history is now displayed directly on the dashboard

### Dashboard UI Improvements

The dashboard UI was enhanced with:
- Skeleton loading states during data fetching
- Color-coded rate limit indicators (green/yellow/red based on remaining capacity)
- Refresh button to manually update statistics
- Empty states with helpful user guidance
- Concise formatting of statistics (e.g., response times in ms/s)
- Dedicated request history component showing past API calls
- Simplified UI focusing on key information
- Removal of unused notification features
- Improved layout by moving the dashboard title to the navbar
- Removed unnecessary search bar to focus on main functionality

## Notes

- Frontend development server runs on port 5173 (or next available port if busy)
- Backend API runs on port 8000
- The project successfully implements all features from Phases 1-7
- All user flows work as expected:
  - User authentication
  - API key management
  - API request building and testing
  - Rate limit visualization
  - Navigation between dashboard sections
- Project follows best practices:
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
  - TDD (Test-Driven Development)
  - Component-based architecture
  - Type safety with TypeScript
  - Consistent error handling

To run the project:
1. Start the backend: `cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

## Project Status

The project is now complete, with all core features implemented and working as expected. The final phase focused on user experience enhancements, particularly improving real-time updates to provide an even more responsive and interactive dashboard.

The application now offers:
- Secure API key management
- Easy-to-use API request building and testing
- Visual rate limit monitoring
- Comprehensive dashboard with usage statistics
- State persistence for a seamless user experience
- Real-time dashboard updates when API keys are modified
- Optimized layout with improved visual hierarchy

All requirements from the project specification have been met, creating a fully functional personal API dashboard.

## Current Phase: 7
