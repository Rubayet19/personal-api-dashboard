# Personal API Dashboard - Memory File

## Current State

The project is a web application for managing API keys and monitoring API usage across various services. It consists of a frontend built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS/Shadcn UI, and a backend using FastAPI and Python.

Phases 1-4 have been completed and all components are now working correctly. The application provides:
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- API key management with secure storage
- API request building and testing interface
- Modern UI with Shadcn UI components

Recent fixes that were implemented:
- Added missing `api` object export to api.ts for proper API client functionality
- Fixed import paths in ApiRequestForm and ApiResponse components
- Added consistent layout with Sidebar to the ApiRequestPage
- Fixed navigation from Dashboard to API Request Builder
- Added `get_api_key_by_id` alias function in backend's mock_db.py
- Properly implemented Shadcn UI components with all required dependencies
- Resolved dependency conflicts by enforcing correct package versions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend

#### Component Architecture
- Following KISS and DRY principles with focused components under 200 lines
- Using shadcn/ui components based on Radix UI primitives
- Consistent error handling with Toast notifications
- Responsive design that works on all devices

#### API Client
- Central `api` object with standard HTTP methods in `api.ts`:
  ```typescript
  export const api = {
    get: async (endpoint: string) => { /* ... */ },
    post: async (endpoint: string, body: any) => { /* ... */ },
    put: async (endpoint: string, body: any) => { /* ... */ },
    delete: async (endpoint: string) => { /* ... */ }
  };
  ```
- Automatic token inclusion for authenticated requests
- Consistent error handling and response formatting

#### State Management
- Using React hooks with TypeScript for type safety
- Local component state for UI interactions
- API communication using the api client
- Authentication state stored in localStorage

#### Navigation
- React Router for routing between pages
- Protected routes that redirect to login if not authenticated
- Consistent Sidebar navigation across all dashboard pages
- Active route highlighting in Sidebar

### Backend

#### Authentication System
- JWT token-based authentication
- In-memory user database for development
- Proper token validation and error handling

#### API Key Management
- Moto for mocking DynamoDB interactions
- Encrypted storage of API keys using Fernet
- Full CRUD operations with authentication checks

#### Proxy Service
- Implemented with httpx for forwarding API requests
- Support for authentication with stored API keys
- Rate limit header parsing and forwarding
- Error handling for various failure scenarios

#### Database Structure
- API Keys table with:
  - id (primary key)
  - user_id (for filtering keys by user)
  - api_name (for identifying the API service)
  - encrypted_key (the securely stored API key)
  - created_at and updated_at timestamps

## Notes

- Frontend development server runs on port 5173 (or next available port if busy)
- Backend API runs on port 8000
- The project successfully implements all features from Phases 1-4
- All user flows work as expected:
  - User authentication
  - API key management
  - API request building and testing
  - Navigation between dashboard sections
- Project follows best practices:
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
  - Component-based architecture
  - Type safety with TypeScript
  - Consistent error handling

To run the project:
1. Start the backend: `cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
