# Personal API Dashboard - Memory File

## Current State

The project is a web application for managing API keys and monitoring API usage across various services. It consists of a frontend built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS/Shadcn UI, and a backend using FastAPI and Python.

All phases of the project have been completed, with the dashboard now fully functional. The application provides:
- User authentication with JWT tokens (using modal dialogs)
- API key management with secure storage
- API request building and testing interface
- Modern UI with Shadcn UI components
- Rate limit tracking and visualization for API keys
- State persistence between tabs for the API Request Builder
- Dashboard with real-time statistics for API usage
- Request history display directly on the dashboard
- Real-time dashboard updates when API keys are changed
- User profile dropdown with account information

## AWS Migration Status

### Completed
1. ✅ **AWS Resources Setup**
   - DynamoDB Table


2. ✅ **Backend Code Updates**
   - User authentication migrated to DynamoDB
   - API key storage migrated to real DynamoDB
   - Decision made to keep Redis for rate limits



## DynamoDB Table Structure

The DynamoDB table `api-dashboard` is currently structured as follows:

### Table Configuration
- **Table Name**: `api-dashboard`
- **Partition Key (PK)**: String
- **Sort Key (SK)**: String
- **Billing Mode**: PAY_PER_REQUEST (On-demand)
- **Global Secondary Index (GSI1)**:
  - **Partition Key**: GSI1PK (String)
  - **Sort Key**: GSI1SK (String)
  - **Projection**: ALL

### Data Patterns

#### User Records
```
{
  'PK': 'USER#<email>',                 // Partition key - User identifier with email
  'SK': 'PROFILE',                      // Sort key - Constant value for user profiles
  'email': '<email>',                   // User's email address
  'hashed_password': '<bcrypt_hash>',   // Encrypted password using bcrypt
  'GSI1PK': 'USERS',                    // GSI partition key for querying all users
  'GSI1SK': '<email>'                   // GSI sort key for sorting users
}
```

#### API Key Records
```
{
  'PK': 'USER#<email>',                 // Partition key - User identifier with email
  'SK': 'APIKEY#<key_id>',              // Sort key - API key identifier with UUID
  'id': '<key_id>',                     // UUID for the API key
  'user_id': '<email>',                 // User's email address
  'api_name': '<service_name>',         // Name of the API service (e.g., 'github')
  'encrypted_key': '<encrypted_value>', // Encrypted API key value
  'created_at': '<timestamp>',          // ISO timestamp of creation
  'updated_at': '<timestamp>',          // ISO timestamp of last update
  'GSI1PK': 'USER#<email>',             // GSI partition key for querying by user
  'GSI1SK': 'APIKEY#<key_id>'           // GSI sort key for API keys
}
```

### Access Patterns

1. **Get User by Email**
   - Direct lookup using PK='USER#<email>' and SK='PROFILE'

2. **Get All Users**
   - Query GSI1 with GSI1PK='USERS'

3. **Get All API Keys for a User**
   - Query base table with PK='USER#<email>' and SK begins_with('APIKEY#')

4. **Get Specific API Key**
   - Direct lookup using PK='USER#<email>' and SK='APIKEY#<key_id>'
   - Alternatively, scan with filter on id='<key_id>' (less efficient)

This structure provides efficient access patterns while maintaining the relationships between users and their API keys. The GSI enables querying across all users or all API keys when needed.

## AWS Migration Progress

The project is currently being migrated from local development to AWS cloud services. The following AWS resources have been set up:

1. **Amazon DynamoDB Table**
   - Table Name: `api-dashboard`
   - Partition Key: `PK`
   - Sort Key: `SK`
   - GSI: `GSI1` with partition key `GSI1PK` and sort key `GSI1SK`
   - PAY_PER_REQUEST billing mode (on-demand capacity)

2. **Amazon S3 Bucket**
   - Bucket Name: `api-dashboard-frontend-166868085052`
   - Configured for static website hosting
   - Index document: `index.html`
   - Error document: `index.html`
   - Website URL: `http://api-dashboard-frontend-166868085052.s3-website-us-east-2.amazonaws.com`



### DynamoDB Data Patterns
Our DynamoDB table is already structured with a flexible schema that can accommodate all these data types:
- Users: `PK = USER#{username}`, `SK = PROFILE`
- API Keys: `PK = USER#{username}`, `SK = APIKEY#{key_id}`

### Migration Plan
To complete the migration, we need to:

✅ Update Backend Code:
   - ✅ Replace in-memory user store with DynamoDB operations
   - ✅ Replace mock DynamoDB for API keys with real DynamoDB
   - ❌ Replace Redis client with DynamoDB for rate limits (DECIDED TO KEEP REDIS)



This approach follows the KISS principle by using a single storage system (DynamoDB) for all data persistence needs, which simplifies our architecture while maintaining our current application logic.

### Dashboard Statistics

The dashboard now displays real-time statistics through a dedicated backend endpoint that aggregates data from multiple sources:

1. **Total API Keys**: Counts the number of API keys stored by the user
2. **API Calls**: Tracks the total number of API requests made in the last 30 days
3. **Success Rate**: Calculates the percentage of successful API calls (status code < 400)
4. **Average Latency**: Measures the average response time across all API calls
5. **Rate Limits**: Shows rate limit usage with visual progress indicators

The implementation uses:
- In-memory request logging for development (would use CloudWatch in production)
- Redis for storing rate limit information
- Aggregated statistics endpoint to reduce client-side data processing
- Optimistic UI updates with loading states for a responsive experience

### Request Logging

A new request logging system was implemented to track API usage:
- Each API call is logged with timestamp, URL, method, status code and response time
- Logs are filtered by user to maintain data isolation
- Logs can be queried by date range for historical analysis
- Success rate is calculated based on HTTP status codes
- Average latency provides insights into API performance
- Request history is now displayed directly on the dashboard

### Dashboard UI Improvements

The dashboard UI was enhanced with:
- Skeleton loading states during data fetching
- Color-coded rate limit indicators (green/yellow/red based on remaining capacity)
- Refresh button to manually update statistics
- Empty states with helpful user guidance
- Concise formatting of statistics (e.g., response times in ms/s)
- Dedicated request history component showing past API calls
- Simplified UI focusing on key information
- Removal of unused notification features
- Improved layout by moving the dashboard title to the navbar
- Removed unnecessary search bar to focus on main functionality
- Added user profile dropdown with email display
